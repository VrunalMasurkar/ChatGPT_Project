Project Title: Anti-tremor Parkinson’s Glove Team Members and Roles:Ann-Marie Kattan: Mechanical Engineering, Junior - Team leader, coordinates project activities and liaises with community partners and stakeholders.Thomas Goodwin: Mechanical Engineering, Junior - Focuses on mechanical design and hardware integration.Aashrita Machiraju, Adviana Kirubalin, Sahil Panjwani: Computer Science, Junior/Freshman - Responsible for software development, data analysis, and integration of control systems. Community Partner Details:Jo Rosen: Founder of the Parkinson’s Resource Organization, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting individuals and families affected by Parkinson's disease. Jo's experience as a double caregiver inspired her to establish an organization focused on providing resources and support to the Parkinson's community. Problem Statement:  The project addresses the autonomy and independence challenges faced by individuals with Parkinson's Disease, focusing on reducing their dependence on caregivers through innovative wearable technology. Understanding Parkinson's Disease:Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that predominantly affects the motor system, leading to symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, slowness of movement, and balance problems. As the disease advances, these symptoms intensify, severely impacting patients' quality of life. The decline in motor control and muscle coordination makes simple daily activities increasingly challenging, eroding patients' autonomy and independence.Challenges Faced by Individuals with PD:-	Physical Limitations: The tremors and rigidity associated with PD restrict the ability to perform basic tasks such as dressing, eating, writing, and walking.-	Psychosocial Impact: The loss of independence can lead to frustration, depression, and anxiety, further compounding the individual's challenges.-	Caregiver Dependence: As PD progresses, the level of care and assistance required from caregivers escalates, often leading to caregiver burnout and financial strain on families.The Role of Wearable Technology:-	Direct Intervention: The project's wearable technology is engineered to provide direct intervention by stabilizing tremors and improving motor function. This could potentially restore the ability to perform daily activities with less or no assistance.-	Non-Invasiveness: In contrast to other treatments like medication, which may have systemic side effects, or surgical interventions such as Deep Brain Stimulation, which are invasive, the wearable technology offers a non-invasive and potentially safer alternative.-	Long-Term Benefits: By focusing on non-invasive stimulation methods, the project aims not only to offer immediate tremor relief but also to explore the potential for long-term neuromuscular benefits, perhaps even slowing the progression of certain PD symptoms.-	Enhanced Autonomy: The goal of this technology is to enhance the autonomy of PD patients, allowing them to regain confidence in their ability to perform daily tasks and reducing their reliance on caregivers.-	Social Implications: By improving patients' independence, the technology also aims to alleviate the emotional and physical demands placed on caregivers, contributing to a better quality of life for all involved.The Commitment to Innovation:-	Iterative Design: The project's approach is rooted in iterative design and continuous improvement, incorporating feedback from patients and caregivers to refine and enhance the technology.-	Accessibility and Affordability: A key consideration in the design is to ensure that the final product is accessible and affordable for a wide range of users, addressing one of the critical barriers to technology adoption in PD care.-	Community Engagement: The project maintains a strong commitment to engaging with the PD community, ensuring that the developed solutions are grounded in the real-world experiences and needs of those most affected by the disease. Technical Description and Specifications:Device Focus:The development of this device, an anti-tremor glove, represents a confluence of biomedical engineering and neurotherapeutic techniques.
