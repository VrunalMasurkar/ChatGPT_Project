What kind of permits are required to be in appropriate operating conditions for the city of Tempe?,null
Are there any specific zoning laws on the street?,"A right of way permit is something that will need to be considered for testing, hours of operation, and other concerned matters. The team would also have to consider signage for designating the pilot section for testing the robot. The signs would also need"
What are the usual costs for obtaining the proper permits?,Fees might likely be waived once signed off on. This is a concern of the engineering department.
Would there be any concerns about the cleaning robot's operating hours?,Full size city sweepers typically sweep very late at night. Approximately from 2 am in the morning aiming to finish around 6 – 7 am. Operating hours would need to be at a different time to avoid conflict.
How frequently should the robot be operated?,null
Could it be once a day? Every few days?,Cleaning happens every 2 – 3 weeks when it comes to full-size sweepers.
operating?,Unsure but more than likely will have to be a concern on ASU’S part.
Are there concerns about the sustainability of the robot?,One thing to consider is the condition of the brushes that will sweep very old pavement. We must consider replacing and maintenance of the robot quite often for the process. We also need to consider larger items that the robot would not be able to pick up.
Would the city require some sort of city department or student organization to maintain the robot once the project is delivered?,This will have to be continued student organization. There are too many things and regulations the city must uphold. They can accept just one organizations device.
Would there be someone to dispose of any trash or debris that the robot would pick up?,The team must consider how often the trash and debris must be emptied. There is a container on site used for full-sized sweepers. The size of the robot probably would designate a much smaller load.
"In terms of design decisions, would you prefer for there to be an on-board rechargeable system through solar panels and batteries or a station for the robot to recharge at?","As far as the current sweepers go, they use diesel or natural gas. Charging and power is up to the team."
Are environmental conditions a huge concern?,"We have considered using materials that could be sustainable under the intense summer heat, the colder conditions in the winter, dust buildup, and other precautions that will be required to be taken in weatherproofing."
What challenges or pain points have you faced regarding navigation on campus that the augmented reality map could address?,null
"Why do you think that an augmented reality map would best address any navigation concerns for individuals on campus, especially for those who require accessibility accommodations?","The augmented reality map will be easier for students to use because it offers accurate visual guidance and is interactive with the user. With the augmented reality map, the user can have very clear directions of where they need to go."
Are there any existing technologies or platforms that you are currently using for the existing problem?,There are no existing technologies or platforms that currently exist for this problem.
Why do you think the existing navigation tools for ASU may fall short in meeting the needs of new students and faculty?,
What specific areas on campus have been identified as challenging to navigate for ASU students and faculty?,
How might the augmented reality map address accessibility concerns for users with different needs?,The augmented reality map addresses accessibility concerns for users with different needs because it will have a simple interface and be easy to use. This is because the augmented reality map includes a flag system that points to the direction of the building that the user wants to go to.
What are the preferred development platforms or environments for building the augmented reality map?,There are no preferred development platforms or environments for building the augmented reality map.

"What specific problem in the current market for athlete's prosthetics are you trying to solve? In other words, what criteria would a successful design meet?",The market potential for adaptive sports is larger than we think
(Follow up to #3) Why does this problem in the market exist?,"Cost, especially a barrier to someone with additional medical issues given that there is no medical waiver / insurance help"
Will we be designing a prosthetic for a specific individual or individuals?,"No, we could speak to athletes to learn more"
Which specific body part would you like us to design a prosthetic for?,open
What kinds of accessibility devices do people without mobility in that area currently use in daily life? Do you know specific examples of such mobility brands or products?,Personal modification of existing mobility devices is common for specializing in certain sports
What is the most common adaptive sports equipment?,"Running equipment, the blade prosthetics used for running are currently a thousand $ or more"
What are the current issues/challenges you have with the devices?,Expensive
Like selling different shoes sizes?,How do we bring the cost down (change in material or manufacturing design?); should be more customizable so that customers do not need to modify it themselves
"There are some sports that change rules once adapted (i.e. wheelchair fencing). Should this device create a new version of the sport, or allow more people to play with the existing rules?","Not against sports with different rules, it is common in paralympic games"
"If this is a professional sport, does the device need to fit within certain regulations?","General public is the ideal market, most of those people will not be pros"
How much would you be willing to pay for such a device?,"Audience being general informs the price, should be kept low"
How long would you be willing to wait if the device had to be custom-fit?,"Customization is almost a necessity, since no two disabilities will need the same device"
"When focusing on bilateral amputees, what kind of attachment to the board gives them the most stability, and accessibility to make turns and quick movements?","Prosthetic attachments are standardized and called universal prosthetic pyramid adapters. So long as any attachment developed includes the universal adapter, then the boarder will be stable."
Is there a certain amount of space we need to have between the bindings/attachments that could be regulated/mass produced?,"Zach Sherman has 19.5 inches between bindings, which is a little farther than shoulder width apart, and is ideal for snowboarding. The pylons on his protheses are modified to allow for his bindings to be that far apart without forcing him to spread his legs too far apart."
"When building a snowboard for a bilateral amputee, what is the best size board for them to get the most control?","The board size really depends on the preferences/size of the boarder, but at around 4’10” with his prosthetics on and 105 lbs., Zach Sherman prefers a board size around 138, though he has tried boards in the range of 135 to 140."
"How much help can we expect the amputees to have when getting into the snowboard, help from others or entirely alone?","The expectation is that the amputee has someone with them to help, whether that be pulling them along flat stretches or valeting their wheelchair."
"How structurally sound should we require these boards to be? Will these boards be more low action recreational, or should we expect amputees to be performing significant jumps?","The board should be able to accommodate whatever level the customer desires, however, in the case of Zach Sherman, the board does not necessarily need to be able to endure any boarding beyond that of a moderate/recreational snowboarder, as making large leaps/jumps is not probable for Zach Sherman at this point in his boarding career."
"What are design implications that you feel have been overlooked or brushed over in the past, and how can we address them more effectively?","The primary design implications that Zach Sherman reported to have been overlooked in previous designs were the weight of the prosthetic adapters and the lack of suspension, as heavy prosthetics and lack of suspension lead to pelvic and spinal stress and injury."
"What are the most important features in a piece of adaptive equipment, can you rank them, and tell us why they are ranked in the order that they are?","Zach Sherman listed the most important features, in order, to include suspension, conserving weight, and maintaining the height he is at in his current snowboard. Suspension and conserving weight were ranked as most important because they are the largest contributors to injury and pain associated with snowboarding for him, as he does not have knees to absorb bumps and falls the way that fully limbed snowboarders do. He noted that the height he is at is ideal because he is tall enough to use standard chair lifts with minimal accommodations without compromising his ability to snowboard, aka keeping his center of gravity as low as possible."
"What would be your preferred way to travel across flat surfaces? Do you want to be able to unstrap one leg from the board and skate (push off with one leg and glide on the snow with the leg that’s strapped to the board) like snowboarders usually do, or would you prefer to unstrap both legs from the board and walk?","Zach Sherman's preferred method of traveling across snowbanks is being pulled by someone with him using an outrigger (similar to a cane), as it is easier for him to wheelchair to the mountain, strap both legs into his board, and not need to walk/unstrap from the board until he is done boarding for the day, and needs someone with him to valet his wheelchair anyways."
What has the production price been in the past and what was one major factor that led to the price making it an inaccessible product?,"Zach Sherman was unsure of production costs for past solutions, but he knew that a previous group at Penn State spent between $600 and $800 on shock absorbers and had access to likely several hundred dollars' worth of sheet metal like aluminum to develop their final prototype."
Are there any safety precautions specific to snowboarders who are above the knee amputees that we should take into consideration while designing a snowboard?,"Though Zach Sherman couldn't cite any industry standards for safety that he was aware of, he directed us to google standards/details from existing products, and to keep in mind that, although the industry standard is that the weight cap for typical prosthetic devices is 250 lbs, most double leg amputees weigh far less than that, so the design should be able to handle up to 250 lbs at maximum but work ideally for people between 100 and 175 lbs."
How can your knowledge in Environmental Law help us develop our sustainable gardening practice?,"With my knowledge in Environmental Law, I can guide your sustainable gardening practices by ensuring compliance with relevant regulations, advising on eco-friendly techniques, and promoting biodiversity conservation."
How does Environmental Law and carbon removal tie in with our project?,"Environmental Law plays a crucial role in carbon removal initiatives. I can help integrate legal considerations into your project, ensuring alignment with carbon offset standards and facilitating regulatory compliance for a more sustainable impact."
What is your process of giving feedback and sorting through problems?,I provide constructive feedback through clear communication and data-driven insights. I can assist in problem-solving by offering diverse perspectives and suggesting innovative solutions based on the information available.

Would it be possible to modify the existing wind tunnel to allow for wind visualization with something like liquid nitrogen?,"Absolutely, probably not liquid nitrogen, most likely a fog machine or dry ice would be used for the wind visualization."
What shape are the fan blades? Is it a dual fan system?,The fan that was used in the initial deliverable was merely a box fan.
How many models would be ideal for the in-class demonstrations?/How many activities should we have?,There isn’t really a limit but we’re looking at something between 2 and 3 activities. That way we can ensure that the activities are finished in time for the following semester. The activities also shouldn’t be convoluted. Just enough to demonstrate basic principles of aerodynamics.
Should the wind tunnel be collapsable? / Is the wind tunnel movable?,The wind tunnel is already able to be broken down. There are 2-3 parts to it that connect/disconnect. There is a storage closet where it needs to fit into for storage. It can be
What are the dimensions of the wind tunnel like how much weight it can hold?,null
Are there certain components of the design that would be off limits to modify?,Nope! We just need to make sure we have whatever it is that we are modifying—completed by the end of the semester.
What does our funding look like for this project?,It is estimated that at our current stage we have around $1000 that can be put towards the project.
Do you recommend we still use an Online SQL database that was used last semester?,"Up to us, last semester didn’t get that far so we can have the luxury of deciding what we want to do"

How would we improve from the last year’s progress?,We could choose to either reference last year’s work or to start again
What is the recommended method for keeping track of progress?,Use the meeting logs and EPICS documentations
What features should we consider when designing the database?,Choose between either customizable and universal features or a team specific design and start from there
What is the desired estimated duration of the flight?,15-mile radius goal for end goal
What is the weight limit desired for the drone?,1st semester 5lb-10lb
What were the limitations of the current solution you want improved on? What is the difference between the desired outcome and the current solution?,It cannot carry the desired load or go the desired distance.
Are there any specific guidelines on how the drone must be built?,"Must be big enough to carry the load, make sure to get an operator license to fly as it must go over buildings"
"Are there any other specific needs for the user? If not, how would you rank the current requirements/criteria you provided?","The specific criteria are safety, speed of process, accuracy and strength."
What kind of real-life applications will the drone be used for?,This drone would hopefully be used by first responders for wild forest fires in California.
How would you envision the delivery process to be carried out?,It would be loaded manually but it would dispense by itself. Coordinates of those lost or stranded found by GPS. Large drone large weight.
Are there any plans to scale up the operation in the future?,"Yes, to cover a greater surface area, go over higher buildings."
What kind of items will the drone carry?,"Aid for first responders to help with the forest fires, delivery medical supplies."
Are there any safety concerns you would like us to consider?,Apply to drone operator's license as it will be going over building and residential areas.

"What resources are available to the refugees in the camp (materials, tools, supplies)?","Basic tools, mostly not power tools, but handheld tools, and basic supplies they can acquire from the town nearby.  They have access to water but"
"If you don’t know any of the answers to these, who might?",The refugees in the Whatsapp group chat.
Are there any contacts that you believe would be beneficial for us to have?,"A contact is Paul, another refugee in the Ogoja camp."
"What is the long-term goal for this refugee camp (stay, migrate, build a community, etc.)?",The plan is to continue staying in Nigeria and continue growing their community.
What else do you think would be helpful for us to know about?,null

Should our team place a higher priority on developing the physical prototype or the mobile application?,"The physical prototype is higher priority than the mobile app, focus on scaling the physical prototype to a practical size."
developing autonomous abilities for the vehicle?,"Half of our team should focus on autonomous abilities, and half should focus on scaling up the physical prototype."
To what scale should we iterate our physical prototype this semester?,"Ideally, our team should build an autonomous electric golf cart this semester, as each project should be 3 semesters so it would be best to start working on a functional device now."
How should we build a golf cart within our budget?,Our team should get in touch with the ASU Disability Resource Center business department for funding and talk to Nali from the EPICS team. We can also consider CAD/3D printing the frame and engine golf of the golf cart and only buying the battery component.
Where would we store the golf cart?,null
Our team would be assigned an outdoor locker for the golf cart by the EPICS program. How would we make the electric golf cart operate autonomously?,There are kits available that can attach to any car or similar vehicle to take control of devices such as the steering wheel and make the car operate autonomously.
What do you think about how we are testing the product? Do you have any suggestions on how we could test our product?,"A: Fischer suggested that we have different liquids to test besides water, like the gel that is inside ice packs. He will collect ice packs to give us so we can test the liquids inside."
Does our design from last semester still hold up to the standards of what our project expects us to deliver?,"A: Fischer told us to consider the following variables: time, temp, how long does it stay, when does it drop to test with our protype... as well as how much liquid and linear feet of line (do the math)."
Does our testing plan cover all areas of testing required for a successful product?,null
What are some variables for testing?,null
How do we prototype?,null
"Modeling through paper at the start, or even get a cardboard box and glue the tube in a certain pattern. We then test how does the product of our liquid (haven't decided what liquid to use yet) flow through the tube and does the tubing sustain the liquid?",null

"Has there been any new system currently established or prototyped in the healthcare infrastructure that is responsible for allocating and assigning patients to ECMOs (ventilators) based on their medical needs and priority levels? Since our last meeting, has there been any change in the needs that need to be addressed by our project solution?",There have not been any new systems or infrastructures established to assign and allocate ECMO machines to patients throughout Arizona. The defining factors of allocating ECMO machines on a priority basis still majorly remain the same. Our project needs and definition statement remain the same.
Can we walk through the current healthcare system in person to understand the entire process?,"Unfortunately, due to the complications that come with handling medical data, there is currently no opportunity for our team to get any current data regarding ECMO machines and patient information. Also, it is difficult for Mayo Clinic to"
"Since our previous meeting, have there been any alterations or developments in the project requirements or specific needs that we should be aware of, prompting a reassessment or adjustment of our current approach?","Since our previous meeting, there have been no alterations of development in the project requirements that would prompt a reassessment of our current approach. The application’s design looks good as well and is ready to be brought to life."
How do you think we can assess the impact of our app on healthcare delivery in Arizona?,"Our application is going to have a significant positive impact on the healthcare systems of Arizona, both in the urban and rural areas. This is because there is no current system in place that allocates ECMO devices to patients. Therefore, rural Arizona is underrepresented in the healthcare system. Our app would exclude diversity of patients as a defining factor in allocating ECMO, thus working towards breaking the current barriers in place for rural Arizonan patients. A more definitive and quantitative impact of our project can be assessed once our application is out for testing."
Would bending in the elbow be an option?,null
"Question: What are the main needs in the la Calle Real, Nicaragua?",Answer: There is a major need for access to clean water. (A well is currently installed in the community but does not generate sufficient energy to be utilized to its full capacity). There is also a need for a more sustainable source of energy. The current power grid does not provide enough energy to the community center and the power often goes out throughout the day.
Question: If we were to help coordinate the installation of solar panels would this be a feasible solution to help generate sufficient power for both the local well and the community center?,"Answer: On a given day, approximately 5.77 kW are used by the community center. Therefore, if the EWB Nicaragua Solar Project team are able to purchase and help install enough solar panels to produce this amount of power, then yes it would be a wonderful solution!"
Question: What are the dimensions of the community center?,null

Question: What will be the cost of travel for students that potentially plan on traveling down to help install the solar panels?,Answer: The trip will cost approximately $750-800 (not including air travel). Although students may receive a discounted price if they are interested in staying with a boarding family for the week and/or in the community center itself.
Question: When would the trip to la Calle Real take place?,Answer: Most likely in the second week of June 2024. Although the exact travel dates are still up to change.
Last summer we determined that for travel to Kenya in 2024 we do not need to be there as long as 2.5-3 weeks as we did last year. What is the timeline that you suggest for this summer’s travels?,null
"This summer we have the Well Team traveling to Kenya for their assessment trip and the BTTC Team traveling for their implementation trip in Kenya. Since transport is often an issue in Kenya, do you suggest these teams travel at the same time, overlapping times, or completely different times?",null
"Last summer we determined that having more people than fit in a typical 7- or 8-seater van per project is too many to easily travel with in-country. There are much more people on our teams than 5 people, accounting for our industry mentor, the driver, and our travel guide. How do you suggest we determine who gets to go on the trip?",null
What time frame works for you to travel to Kenya this summer? Last summer we agreed that we would rather finish our trip and return earlier than before. This is because it ran right into move in/ move out days for students and close to school starting. Are you still on board with this?,null

Have there been any damaging floods in the past few months that you’re aware of?,"In general, most severe floods occur during monsoon season and in the Spring as snow in the area melts. As it has been getting colder overall since the last meeting in November, there has not been any significant flooding."
Are there any other plans for construction or landscape work in the area?,There are still no plans for construction to be done in or around the project site.
"As the team has concluded that removing the large invasive trees is unfeasible for our skillset, greatly increases risk of injury, and may require legal permits that would delay the construction, is it alright if we forgo the removal of invasive trees for now?","They are overall not satisfied with the tree situation, but they understand that attempting to remove them now may do more harm than good. They said that they have been trying to work with higher-level councils to remove the trees for a while now but had no success."
Are there any good sources of wood or rock nearby for use in the construction?,They explained that there are likely no sources for rocks nearby and that finding a wood source is unlikely.
Would it be possible to change our meeting time so that we do not have to take up the time from your leadership meetings and to have a dedicated person to work with?,"They have no one able to work with our project directly for the time being. As long as our meetings are once a month at most and we keep our section around 30 minutes, they are fine with the current arrangement."
What do you need included in the E-guide so that Countdown would feel prepared to start manufacturing in Ghana?,"Jasmine needs the manufacturing plan, quality assurance plan, an instruction manual, and an estimated cost to purchase all the equipment.

"For Kickstarter, what are you comfortable pricing the table and chair at?",Jasmine and the Countdown organization will take care of pricing and creating the tiers for Kickstarter. The EPICS team will handle the story and video section of the profile.
What are you looking for in a post project plan after EPICS is completed?,Jasmine is not quite sure what kind of support she would need from the EPICS team. The team lead suggested that the team remain in contact or employed with Luminosity Lab to provide support for the project integration in Ghana. Agreed to reconvene at a later time to discuss a more detailed plan.
Question: Thoughts on the attendance record filtering options?,"Answer: ASURITE (Login ID in Canvas) should be considered for people searching, in addition to first-last name and 10-digit ASU ID (SIS ID in Canvas). Separate fields should be consolidated into a single text field that can multiplex filter by the aforementioned fields."
Question: General thoughts on section selector dropdown?,"Answer: As LTI access workaround involves using a personal Canvas API token, application is unaware of the course shell it is being accessed from. At the minimum, filtering should be done to categorize the numerous course shells and potentially even larger of sections to minimize information overload. This issue will be eliminated in the future with LTI access, which contains course shell ID in session info. Short term workaround could consist of embedding course ID as URL parameter in embed on Canvas page."
Question: Thoughts on the card reader pairing functionality and user interfaces?,null
"Answer: Course staff should not be expected to look through a list of online readers and select the reader they are currently using every time they use the system, they should be able to select a default/preferred reader, that will automatically pair with the press of “start” button or at the class start time. Readers should automatically unpair at the class end time. Perhaps a pairing override feature?",null
"Question: Thoughts on the autograder feature functionality and user interface (not yet implemented). Is the current design of a rubric selector (defines grading criteria of present, late, absent) and a manual",null

What is the number of gestures that can be recognized from each additional emg sensor?,The number of gestures that can be recognized from each additional emg sensor is about 0.5. The bare minimum amount of emg sensors required for the operation of the arm would be two. One on the flexor digitorum profundus and another on the pronator quadratus is the best for a two sensor setup.
What size would you recommend for a child?,The size would be of a example child arm that Noah had showed us. The important thing to note is that this is about half the width of the adult palm as seen in this picture below.
"What is more important: accuracy, delay time, or cost of product?","We can have more accuracy by getting more input. This can either be from the existing emg sensors or from more emg sensors. This, however, causes more delay in reaction because more computation is required. We can remedy this by upgrading our hardware such as the computer used but this requires us to make the prosthetic more expensive."
