It involves managing relationships with suppliers, optimizing logistics and inventory levels, and ensuring redundancy to mitigate risks such as material shortages or supplier failures. Strong supply chain management can significantly enhance the ability to scale operations efficiently."Question 31:- Student: "What role does cybersecurity play in the development of modern prosthetics, especially those integrated with smart technologies?"- Community Partner (Star Strahan): "As prosthetics become more integrated with smart technologies, including IoT devices and AI, cybersecurity becomes crucial to protect user data and ensure device functionality. Developers must incorporate strong encryption methods, secure data storage solutions, and continuous monitoring for potential threats to maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of their products."Question 32:- Student: "How can prosthetic developers ensure their products are inclusive and meet the needs of diverse populations?"- Community Partner (Star Strahan): "Ensuring inclusivity involves engaging with diverse user groups during the design process, conducting needs assessments across different demographics, and considering factors such as different body sizes, ethnicities, and gender. It also includes addressing economic accessibility and creating designs that are adaptable to various cultural norms and preferences."Question 33:- Student: "Discuss the impact of health insurance policies on the adoption of advanced prosthetic technologies."- Community Partner (Star Strahan): "Health insurance policies greatly impact the adoption of advanced prosthetics as they often determine what devices are accessible to patients based on coverage and reimbursement levels. Advocating for comprehensive coverage of advanced prosthetics requires demonstrating their long-term cost benefits, such as reduced healthcare visits and improved quality of life, to insurance providers."Question 34:- Student: "What future technologies do you foresee becoming integral to prosthetic development within the next decade?"- Community Partner (Star Strahan): "I anticipate that advancements in nanotechnology, biomaterials, and tissue engineering will become integral. These could lead to prosthetics that are bio-integrated, capable of growing with the user, and perhaps even responding to neural commands more seamlessly. Additionally, AI and machine learning will increasingly be used to personalize prosthetic functions and adapt to user behaviors in real-time."
